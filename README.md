# core-web-client - project

Boilerplate of react-typescript application.

This is frontend for my Asp.Net Core application: https://github.com/Volodymyr759/core-web-api

## Includes:

- Authentication process, based on JWT-tokens (access / refresh);

- CRUD-functionality with filtering, sorting and pagination;

- Redux;

- Uses Material UI design system.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
